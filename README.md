# wbc_msgs 

This library provides ROS/ROS2 messages for the [Whole-Body Control library](https://github.com/ARC-OPT/wbc).

WBC was initiated and is currently developed at the [Robotics Innovation Center](http://robotik.dfki-bremen.de/en/startpage.html) of the [German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI)](http://www.dfki.de) in Bremen.
